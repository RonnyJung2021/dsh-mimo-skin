# Third-party notices

This package is MIT (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). The built host bundle
`lib/index.js` **inlines** the following MIT-licensed packages, so their
copyright and permission notices are reproduced here and appended to that
artifact by `build.mjs`. Nothing else third-party ends up in a build: the
browser bundle `lib/client.js` reaches React only through the engine's own
module table.
